            <h3>Technology</h3>
            <h1>Innovation you can see, hear, and feel.</h1>
            <p>Pushing boundaries from the inside out. Spatial experiences on Apple Vision Pro are only possible through groundbreaking Apple technology. Displays the size of a postage stamp that deliver more pixels than a 4K TV to each eye. Incredible advances in Spatial Audio. A revolutionary dual‑chip design featuring custom Apple silicon. A sophisticated array of cameras and sensors. All the elements work together to create an unprecedented experience you have to see to believe.</p>
            <img src="./image/hero_base.jpg" alt="">
            <h2>More pixels than a 4K TV. For each eye.</h2>
            <p>The custom micro‑OLED display system features 23 million pixels, delivering stunning resolution and colors. And a specially designed three‑element lens creates the feeling of a display that’s everywhere you look.</p>
            <img src="./image/spatial_audio_base.jpg" alt="">
            <h2>Our most advanced Spatial Audio system ever.</h2>
            <p>Dual-driver audio pods positioned next to each ear deliver personalized sound while letting you hear what’s around you. Spatial Audio makes sounds feel like they’re coming from your surroundings. Audio ray tracing analyzes your room’s acoustic properties to adapt and match sound to your space. And if you want to use headphones with Apple Vision Pro, AirPods Pro (2nd generation) with USB‑C offer the perfect experience, featuring Lossless Audio with ultra-low latency enabled by the H2 chip in both devices.</p>
            <img src="./image/eye_tracking.jpg" alt="">
            <h2>Responsive, precision eye tracking.</h2>
            <p>A high‑performance eye‑tracking system of LEDs and infrared cameras projects invisible light patterns onto each eye. This advanced system provides ultraprecise input without your needing to hold any controllers, so you can accurately select elements just by looking at them.</p>
            <img src="./image/sensors_all__dp.jpg" alt="">
            <h2>A sophisticated sensor array.</h2>
            <p>A pair of high-resolution cameras transmit over one billion pixels per second to the displays so you can see the world around you clearly. The system also helps deliver precise head and hand tracking and real‑time 3D mapping, all while understanding your hand gestures from a wide range of positions.

            <h1>Revolutionary dual‑chip performance.</h1>
            <p>A unique dual‑chip design enables the spatial experiences on Apple Vision Pro. The powerful M2 chip simultaneously runs visionOS, executes advanced computer vision algorithms, and delivers stunning graphics, all with incredible efficiency. And the brand-new R1 chip is specifically dedicated to process input from the cameras, sensors, and microphones, streaming images to the displays within 12 milliseconds — for a virtually lag-free, real-time view of the world.</p>

            <p>1. Testing conducted by Apple in November 2023 using preproduction Apple Vision Pro units and software. Testing consisted of full battery discharge while performing each of the following tasks: video playback, internet browsing, spatial video capture, and FaceTime. Video playback tested in conjunction with an Environment, using 2D movie content purchased from the Apple TV app. Internet browsing tested using 20 popular websites. FaceTime tested between two Apple Vision Pro units with Personas enabled. Tested with Wi-Fi associated to a network. Battery life depends on device settings, usage, network, environmental conditions, and many other factors. Battery tests are conducted using specific Apple Vision Pro units; actual results may vary.</p>
